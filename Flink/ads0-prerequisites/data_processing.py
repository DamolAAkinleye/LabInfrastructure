def normalize_prices(prices):
    '''
    This function takes an observation of prices of some commodity for
    business hours during the days of the week (represented as a list (for
    different days) of list (for different hours) of numbers (for the prices).
    It normalises the prices so the first value is worth 100.

    E.g., normalize_prices([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) is [[100, 200], [300, 400]]
    E.g., normalize_prices([[200, 20], [30, 400]]) is [[100, 10], [15, 200]]

    @param prices a list of list of prices
    @return a normalised list of list of prices where the first price is 100
    and the other prices are scaled accordingly
