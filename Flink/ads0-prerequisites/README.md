# Prerequisites

A few exercises to freshen up on your Python skills and check that you are
ready for the ADS program.


## Instructions

- Fork the repository.
- Clone your fork on your computer.
- Work on your submission (see *Work* below).
- Commit and push your work.


## Work

Work is separated in a number of challenges. There are short descriptions of
each below.

Simply edit the Python files by completing the functions within. You should
complete the function bodies so they match the description in the file's
comments.

Feel free to create new functions if it suits you. However, do not delete or
rename existing functions.



## Business Intelligence

In the file `business_intelligence.py` you will implement a function
to calculate profitability of orders. This will test your knowledge of
arithmetic and control-flow structures in Python.

## Customer management

In the file `customers.py` you will implement a function to prepare a
marketing campaign. This will test your knowledge of data structures as you
extract information from a customer database.

## Data processing

In the file `data_processing.py` you will implement two functions to modify
raw data. This will tests your knowledge of data structures as well as simple
maths.

## Order management

In the file `orders_management.py` you will implement multiple functions to
handle orders made by customers. This will test your knowledge of arithmetic
and nested data structures.

## Parking management

In the file `parking_management.py` you will implement several functions to
handle a record of cars entering and exiting a parking. This will test your
knowledge of control-flow structures, data structures and the use of time
stamps.

## Statistics

In the file `statistics.py` you will implement a function to compute the mean
and median of a sample of measures. This will test your knowledge of basic
statistics and arithmetic.

## Text analysis

In the file `text_analysis.py` you will extract information from a text. This
will test your knowledge of string handling and regular expressions in Python.

## Transactions

In the file `transactions.py` you will implement a function to extract
information from a log of financial transaction. This will test your
knowledge of data structures, arithmetic, control-flow structure and time
stamps.

This is a wrap-up exercise that uses notions from most of the other exercises.
