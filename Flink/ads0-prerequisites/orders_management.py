# ORDER AND CART MANAGEMENT #

# Orders are list of ordered items
# An order item has four components:
# - a name
# - a quantity (the number of such items bought)
# - a price (in pence)
# - a weight (in pounds)

# DO NOT MODIFY CONSTANTS

def delivery_charges(order):
    '''
    Compute the delivery charges for an order. The company charges a flat £50
    fee plus £20 for each 100lbs (additional weight under 100lbs is ignored).

    E.g., delivery_charges([("Desk", 1, 11999, 160)]) is 7000 (pence)
    E.g., delivery_charges([("Desk", 2, 11999, 160)]) is 11000 (pence)
    E.g., delivery_charges([("Lamp", 1, 2399, 2)]) is 5000 (pence)
    E.g., delivery_charges([("Lamp", 50, 2399, 2)]) is 7000 (pence)

    @param order the order to process. See samples for examples.
    @return the delivery fee in pence

def total_charge(order):
    '''
    Compute the total charge for an order. It includes:
        - total price of items,
        - VAT (20% of the price of items),
        - delivery fee

    NOTE: in this computation, VAT is not applied to the delivery

    E.g., total_charge([("Desk", 2, 11999, 160)]) is 39797 (pence)
    E.g., total_charge([("Lamp", 50, 2399, 2)]) is 150940 (pence)

    @param order the order to process. See samples.
    @return the total price, in pence, rounded to the nearest penny.

def add_item_to_order(name, quantity, order):
    '''
    When a customer adds items to their basket, you need to update their
    order. The customer provides some of the details (the name of the item and
    the quantity they want); the CATALOGUE contains additional details (price
    and weight).

    NOTE: you must return a new order list and leave the argument unmodified.

    NOTE: if the order already contains some of the item, you must update the
    quantity field for that item; otherwise, you must add a new entry in the
    order

    NOTE: if the item cannot be found in the order or the catalogue, the
    function should return None

    E.g., add_item_to_order("table", 1, [("table", 1, 9999, 20)]) is
    [("table", 2, 9999, 20)]
    E.g., add_item_to_order("chair", 1, [("table", 1, 9999, 20)]) is
    [("table", 1, 9999, 20), ("chair", 1, 2999, 5)]

    @param name the name of the item to add
    @param quantity the number of items to add
    @param order the previous order
    @return a new order with the added items. If the item is unknown, return
    None instead.
